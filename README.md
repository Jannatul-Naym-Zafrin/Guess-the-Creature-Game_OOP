Guess the Creature

CSE 1116 – Object Oriented Programming Laboratory Project

Guess the Creature is a simple interactive game built using the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visualisation.

🎮 How the Game Works

The player first thinks of (or selects) a creature from a list of 10 creatures.

The game then asks 4 questions related to the guessed creature.

Based on the player's answers, the program predicts which creature was guessed.

Finally, the image of the predicted creature is displayed.
